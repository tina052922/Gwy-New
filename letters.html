                <div class="special-letter-content">
                    <p>Happy happy birthday to the smartest, goofiest, sassiest, and most amazing girl in my life. I'm so grateful for everything you do and for just even existing. Life wasn't so full of color until you came into my life. Indeed, God worked in the most unexpected ways. It's crazy how 1 person's existence can just emulate all the good things this world could ever give and also the privilege to love your existence. You're my dream come true, my love. People say that everyone is not perfect—well, some agree and some don't—but looking at you, I could never want anything to change because, as for me, you are perfect just the way you are. There's nothing wrong about you, my love. I love you so so so so much and I hope you will love yourself as much as I love you, Avi. To me, you don't have to prove anything for me to admire and love you. I love you for you, baby. I wish you more achievements, happy moments, and good health, baby. You make my world so bright. I’m thankful every day that you’re here. You’re my happy place, and I hope this year brings you tons of joy. I’ll keep loving you forever.</p>

                <div class="special-letter-content">
                    <p>Happy birthday, my love—Avi, my langga, my heart. Today’s all about you, and I’m so happy I get to celebrate the best person ever. You’re 20 now, and you already make everything better just by being you. I’m so lucky God picked me to love you. I remember the first time I saw you—I didn’t know you’d be my whole world. You came in like a surprise gift, strong and beautiful. Now, every day with you is special. Life with you is easy because loving you is so simple. I’ll never forget seeing you on stage with your nursing cap, holding your candle so carefully. That was a big moment, and I’m so proud. I know the late nights, the stress, and how much you care. You’re not just a nurse—you’re a light to everyone. I’m proud of who you are. You’re my safe place, too. I laugh when you sleep all funny, taking up the bed—it shows you trust me. I love your little habits. You make me feel safe and loved, and I want to do that for you every day. To me, you’re perfect, Avi. Your silly smile, your sassy words, your huge heart—I wouldn’t change a thing. You don’t need to prove anything—I love you just for being you. I hope you see how great you are. You’re my rock. Even far apart, you make me feel okay. Thanks for being my home and my strength. I can’t thank you enough, but I’ll keep trying by loving you forever. For your 20th birthday, I planned a little trip—just us and the ocean you love, with your favorite seafood. You deserve to relax and feel happy, because you give me that every day. Here’s to you—more wins, more laughs, more us. I wish you health, joy, and a kind world, because you deserve it all. You’re my everything, and I’ll love you always. Happy birthday, my smart, silly, amazing girl. I love you so, so much—more than I can say.</p>

                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>Please know that I’ll stand by your side through every high and every low, with all my heart. You’ve always been there for me, my love, a constant source of comfort even when miles stretch between us. I’m so grateful for the way you pour yourself into making me feel your presence—exhausting every effort to bridge the distance. For the times you’ve held me close, wiping away my tears or wrapping me in your arms until the storm inside me calms. For the tender words you gift me—those sudden, beautiful letters that lift my spirit when I read them. For the comfort food you bring me, even when you’re stretching your own resources thin. Every single gesture is etched deep in my soul, my love, and I’ll carry them with me always. Thank you for being my rock, my safe haven— my one and only home that I can run to whenever life feels too heavy to bear. You’ve given me so much, more than I could ever repay, and I’m endlessly thankful just for the privilege of loving you and being your other half. With you, I feel safe, no matter what chaos surrounds me. Even a fleeting call from you has the power to turn my darkest days bright. I’m overwhelmed with gratitude that God blessed me with you—the very best I could ever hope for. And I promise, my love, I’ll always be here for you too, with every piece of my heart.</p>

                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>Please know I’ll be here for you through good days and hard days, my love. I want to be the one you lean on, just like you’ve always been there for me. I’ll try my best to comfort you, even when we’re miles apart—doing all I can to make you feel I’m close. I’ll hold you tight, wipe your tears, and hug you until you feel okay again. I’ll write you little notes to lift your spirits when you read them. I’ll bring you your favorite food to cheer you up, even if I’m short on cash. These things come straight from my heart, my love, and I hope they stay with you forever. My sweet love, I know hearing about the possibility of ADHD has been heavy for you. I can only imagine the whirlwind of emotions—maybe confusion, relief, fear, or frustration. But please, never think this changes how I see you. You’re still my incredible, shining star, the one I adore with all my soul. If anything, it just shows me more of your beautiful self, and I’m right here with you—you’re never alone. You’re not broken. You’re not less. You’re not just some label. You’re you—kind, brilliant, and so full of love. Your mind dances to its own unique rhythm, and that’s a treasure, not a flaw. And your nursing journey—my heart swells with pride watching you chase this dream. Every late night studying, every tough exam, every moment you push through—I see how much you pour into it. You’re not just learning to care for others; you’re showing the world your huge, giving heart. If ADHD makes those long shifts or endless notes feel harder, it doesn’t mean you’re failing—it means you’re a warrior, fighting for what you love with a strength that takes my breath away. I’m in awe of you, my nurse-in-the-making, and I’ll be your biggest cheerleader every step of the way. If life’s been tougher for you—whether it’s school or anything else—it doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means you’ve been carrying so much, so bravely, for so long. Now, let me carry some of it with you. I’m here, always. Need a reminder for a deadline? I’ve got you. Need help sorting out your books or notes? I’m by your side. Need me to just hold you tight after a draining day at clinicals? I’ll never let go. We’ll take it all one day at a time, together, with no rush. I’ll be your rock, your cozy haven—the home you can run to when the world feels too big. You’re my everything, and loving you lights up my life. I’ll keep you safe, no matter what storms come. A quick call from me will chase away your roughest days. I thank God every single day for you—you’re my greatest gift, my perfect match. I love you beyond words, and no struggle, no diagnosis, no late-night study session will ever dim that. You’re enough—more than enough—just as you are. Always. And I promise, my darling, I’ll be here for you, with every beat of my heart.</p>

                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>My Love, Lately, I’ve witnessed just how heavy life has been on you. The journey of being a student nurse, the weight of academic pressure, strained relationships, financial struggles, and both mental and physical exhaustion—it all seemed to crash down on you at once, like a storm you couldn’t outrun. I’ve seen how overwhelmed, exhausted, and broken you felt while trying to make sense of everything. My heart ached watching you carry all that weight in silence, thinking you had to bear it alone. I can only imagine the wave of emotions crashing inside you—tiredness, frustration, regret, pain, guilt, and the unrelenting pressure. I know how deeply you feel things, how much you overthink, and how quick you are to blame yourself for the things that have happened. But my love, please hear me: *none of this is your fault*. Not even a little. Even when things were at their hardest, you kept going. You’re still standing, still fighting, still trying—and that alone is something to be incredibly proud of. I want you to know that I am not like those who’ve hurt you or your family. I will never be one of them. I’m so proud of your strength, even when you don’t feel strong. I’m here. Always. And I’ll keep reminding you: you are *not* alone in this. We’ll get through it—together. One step, one breath, one day at a time. I won’t leave you behind. I’ll give everything I have to make sure you feel loved, seen, and appreciated. You matter so much to me. Always.</p>

Those days mean everything to me. Your birthday started it all, and that ‘yes’ made us real. I think about them and smile every time.</p>

                    <p>I got to witness another accomplishment in your nursing journey, where you had your first milestone as a student nurse. Seeing you walk up on that stage, smiling as they placed your cap, reaching for the fire to light your candle, and carefully making your way down the aisle, making sure the fire doesn’t go out—I can’t even describe how proud I am. I’ve seen your struggles, your sacrifices, and everything you’ve gone through to get here. And you did it. You endured. That moment showed how strong you are.</p>

I love watching you sleep like that—it’s so cute. It makes me happy knowing you feel good with me. You’re my cozy buddy, and I feel lucky every time I see you so relaxed.</p>

Every day feels light with you here. You make simple stuff fun. I smile more because of you, and I can’t imagine life without you now.</p>
